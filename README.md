## 🚀 Branches

- **Main Branch (master):** This branch represents the `production-ready` code. It should only contain stable and tested code. The app is deployed from this branch.
  
- **Develop Branch:** This branch is where all the `development` work takes place. It contains the latest features and changes being worked on by the team.

- **Feature Branches:** For each new `feature` or task, a feature branch is created from the develop branch. The feature is developed in this branch, and once completed and tested, it's merged back into the develop branch.

- **Release Branches:** When preparing for a new `release`, a release branch is created from the develop branch. This allows code stabilization for the upcoming release without introducing new features.

- **Hotfix Branches:** If a `critical` issue arises in production, a hotfix branch is created from the main branch to fix the issue. The fix is then merged back into both the main and develop branches.

## 🔄 Sequence

- `Feature` -> `Develop` (***Only Developers***)
- `Develop` -> `Release` (***Team Leader***)
